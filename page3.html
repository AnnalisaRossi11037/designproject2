            <section class="textbox"><b>Cats may be less physical effort than other pets, but don't mistake that for them being easy! Cats require lots of grooming, feeding and proper exercise, just like dogs. Firstly, covering food needs, cats need a varied diet. Switching between dry and wet foods, as well as different brands, is a fantastic way to give your kitty all the nutrients they need. Make sure that each brand covers all the important proteins, carbs and vitamins. More info in the "Cat Food!" section. Next up, grooming your cat. Based on the breed of kitty, their fur needs minimal or constant grooming. For example, a Persian cat has very long fur, and this has to be groomed very frequently to prevent fleas, ticks and furballs. However, if you have an American or British shorthair, they require a lot less brushing, but should still be regularly washed. Lastly, exercise. Even though cats are less active than other pets like puppies, they still need to build muscle and have a lot of good exercise. A good way to accomplish this is to set up parcour or little running tracks within your house. These callenge both the mind and bodies of your feline friend, thus giving them all the strength they need without going outside. Reminder, most kitties aren't built for outdoors, so unless you've got a more wild breed, such as a Bengal or Norweigan Forest Cat, make sure they stay home with you.</b></section>
