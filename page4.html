            <section class="textbox3"><b>Cats should be fed from 2-5 times per day, depending on their size and breed. They should be fed good brands and proper diets with their proper nutrition as the first priority! <br><br><br> Your kitty will often have a favorite meal, and although it's beneficial to switch up brands every now and again, consistency can be greatly appreciated by the cat. Make sure to keep a close eye on their reactions to different foods, and give them more of the ones they seem to enjoy. With this, you can guarantee that your feline friend is happy!</b></section>
            <section class="textbox4"><b>The brands that I would personally recommend are: <br><br><br> -Meow Mix <br><br> -Purina One Indoor Advantage <br><br> -Hill's Prescription Diet <br><br> -Iams Proactive <br><br><br> If none of these seem right for your kitty, though, there are many more to choose from with a quick google search!</b></section>
