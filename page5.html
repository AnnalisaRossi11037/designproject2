            <section class="text"><b> 1. Siamese <br><br> Siameses are described as the easiest kitty cats to adopt and take care of. Wirth short fur, a well-behaved nature and lots of love to give, they're definitely great feline friends. <br><br><br> 2. Russian Blue <br><br> Like Siameses, Russian Blues tend to have short fur (which is a blueish-gray) and are often very caring and affectionate towards their owners. They're quite the cuddlebugs!</b></section>
            <section class="text2"><b>3. Maine Coon <br><br> Maine Coons are fluffy, but require less grooming than you'd expect, since they're independant. These gentle giants make great pets for everyone, including you! <br><br><br> 4. Ragdoll <br><br> Ragdolls, essentially just lighter Siameses, are short-furred and affectionate. Plus, they have the quirk of "ragdolling" whenever picked up by their owners.</b></section>
            <section class="text3"><b>5. Persian <br><br> Like Maine Coons, Persians are very fluffy, with long fur. They do tend to need more grooming, but other than that, these smush-faced kitties are perfect pets. <br><br><br> 6. Scottish Fold <br><br> Scottish Folds are known for their cute ears, but more so for their silly nature. They've got short fur and need less care, but the thing they really need is attention!</b></section>
            <section class="text4"><b>7. Sphynx <br><br> Unlike every other cat on this list, Sphynxes do not have any fur at all. They still need to be washed regularly. Despite their odd looks, though, Sphynxes are super cuddly and sweet! <br><br><br> 8. Exotic Shorthair <br><br> Exotic Shorthairs are like shorter furred persians. They have the same smushed-face that I personally find adorable. On top of this, they're very friendly cats!</b></section>
            <section class="text5"><b>9. Norweigan Forest Cat <br><br> Much like Maine Coons, Norweigans are very fluffy. They're adventurous, independant and protective, especially for their owners! <br><br><br> 10. Bengal <br><br> Bengals are super athletic, with slick fur and long bodies for climbing and running. They're very active, which can tire you out, but they become very loving eventually, and bonding with them is crucial.</b></section>
